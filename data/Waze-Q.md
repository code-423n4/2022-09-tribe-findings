#1 Missing zero address check in multiple constructor

Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in multiple constructors.â€¨Impact: Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables.
Add zero-address checks in all the constructors

#2 Missing natspec comment

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L48-L251

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/MerkleRedeemerDripper.sol#L10

All function has a natspec comment to explain utility about function or parameter. So add natspec comment to increase readability and auditability.

#3 Missing indexed field

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/peg/SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L27-L29

event is missing indexed fields. Add indexed at to.

#4 Missing check for zero address

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/peg/SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L33

To avoid zero address. We suggest to add simple check zero address in the function.

#5 Must be immutable

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L25

the state redeemBase can't be initialize by constructor. the constructor parameter mention state redeemBase to initialize. so i suggest to add immutable in redeemBase.

#6 Use of floating pragma

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L2

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/MerkleRedeemerDripper.sol#L2

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L2

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively. Lock the pragma version to the same version as used in the other contracts and also consider known bugs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) for the compiler version that is chosen.
Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile it locally.

#7 Unnecessary import

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L4

The import is not used in any way. Remove it to improve readability of the code

#8 Typo

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L246

Type the word correctly.

#9 Divided by 0

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L58

Division by 0 can lead to accidentally revert.
