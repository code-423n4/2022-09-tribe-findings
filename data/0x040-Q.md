## 1- levitating pragma is set.
### Description
Some contracts have the pragma solidity directive ^0.8.4. It should specify a fixed compiler version to make sure that the bytecode produced 
does not vary between builds. 
This is especially important if you rely on bytecode-level verification of the code.

### Mitigation
Lock the pragma.

## 2- Outdated compiler version.
Utilizing the most recent compiler version is recommended.
The minimal compiler version listed is pretty out of date. Some problems may be present in older compilers.
To ensure the usage of a current compiler, it is advised updating the solidity version pragma to the most recent version.

### Mitigation
Update the pragma to 0.8.16

# NON-CRITICAL

## 1-vent is missing indexed fields
### Description
Off-chain tools that parse events can more quickly access event fields when they are indexed.
However, keep in mind that each index field requires more gas to emit, thus it may not always be ideal to index the maximum permitted per event (three fields).
If there are three or more fields, each event should use three indexed fields, and gas usage is not a major problem for the events in question.

All of the fields should be indexed if there are fewer than three.
