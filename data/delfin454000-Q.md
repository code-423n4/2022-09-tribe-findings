Remove repeated word `the`

### Unclear comment
While a comment may contain abbreviations, shorthand for well-known or previously defined terms, inconsistent or nonstandard punctuation, and use of minor grammatical errors, it should be readable. In other words, it should communicate clearly, immediately and without ambiguity. The readability of the comment below could be improved, as shown:

```solidity
/// preventing it to create new FEI.
```
Replace `to create` with `from creating`

### Long single line comments 
In theory, comments over 79 characters should wrap using multi-line comment syntax. Even if somewhat longer comments are acceptable and a scroll bar is provided, very long comments can interfere with readability. Some of the long comments in `FEI and TRIBE` do wrap (e.g., [TribeRedeemer.sol: L23-24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L23-L24)) â€” the treatment of long comments is inconsistent and should be made consistent. Below are five instances of long comments whose readability could be improved by wrapping, as shown:

### Named `return` variable not used
The existence of a named return variable that is not subsequently used (here, `baseTokenAmount`) is potentially perplexing

        // the amount of cTokens they're turning into the contract
        return (cTokenExchangeRates[cToken] * amount) / 1e18;
