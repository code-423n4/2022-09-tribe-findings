#### AVOID FLOATING PRAGMAS: THE VERSION SHOULD BE LOCKED

The pragma declared across the solution is ^0.8.4 and =0.8.10. Locking the pragma (for e.g. by not using ^ in pragma solidity 0.8.10) ensures that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an older compiler version with unfixed bugs. (see [here](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103))


#### Typo

"int he" should be "in the".

contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol
```solidity
164:    /// Should set the user's claim amount int he claims mapping for the provided cToken
```

#### EVENT IS MISSING INDEXED FIELDS


Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields.

```solidity
contracts/peg/SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol
27:     event Redeem(address to, uint256 amountFeiIn, uint256 amountAssetOut);
29:     event Mint(address to, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountFeiOut);

contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol
14:     event Redeemed(address indexed owner, address indexed receiver, uint256 amount, uint256 base);
```


#### Use custom errors

Custom error can be used, they are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings.
