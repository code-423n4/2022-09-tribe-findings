- In `RariMerkleRedeemer.previewRedeem`, an exchange rate might still be unset (and therefore 0), although it is required to provide 27 exchange rates in the constructor. These exchange rates might be for different tokens or contain duplicates. The consequences of this would be severe, as a user would get 0 `baseToken` for this `cToken`, no matter how many cToken's he owns.
- Unlike in `RariMerkleRedeemer._multiRedeem`, it is not checked in `_redeem` that the address of the `cToken` is not equal to zero.
- The modifier `hasNotSigned` is missing from `RariMerkleRedeemer.signAndClaim`
- Because `RariMerkleRedeemer` only contains `amountToDrip` tokens (because of the Dripper), redemption for whales can take a long time (they always need to wait `_dripPeriod`) and needs to be split up in multiple transactions. This can also introduce situations where a lot of transactions revert: After the `_dripPeriod` is over, everyone rushes to call `drip()` and redeem all tokens, but only one will succeed.
